# What is Personium?  

Personium is a open source PDS (Personal Data Store) server software.

### Anyone can set up a PDS server  

Because it is a open source software, anyone (business, municipality, government, individual, etc.) can become a PDS provider.  

### All functions are REST API  

HTTP can handle any platform (OS, development language), so you do not have to choose the client platform.  

GUI examples for both user and administrator are distributed, please feel free to modify and customize it for your needs.  

### Specify a remote PDS URL to disclose or grant managing permission to your data  

Each Personium PDS is given a URL.  

Disclosing or granting managing permission to your data to the other party (e.g. wife, family doctor, work place, etc.) are done by specifying the other party's PDS URL.  

PDS access uses digital signature technology, therefore, the other party's PDS can be resided on another server.

Passive data subjectï¼š For infants, the elderly, etc., PDS can be handed over to the relatives by granting administrative permission of all data to the relatives.

### Configure web of PDS  
Groups of PDSs composed of the data disclosing and disclosed parties become a decentralized network which does not favor a specific business operator (the only winner). (Distributed social graph)

It is possible to form a huge web of PDSs in which the disparate PDSs are linked together as if the web site hosted on a web server built in pieces was linked and www was created.

We also implement security that is necessary for the formation of an open ecosystem.

### Data subject (=PDS owner) can be extended to objects, organizations, etc., not just limited to people  
Data subjects can be extended to objects, organizations, etc. in the same way as dealing with passive data subjects. (e.g. family/dog Poch's data store)

We recommend an integrated model that handles IoM, IoT, and IoE.(Cyber-Physical)
