<h1>What is Personium?</h1>
<p>Personium is a open source PDS (Personal Data Store) server software.</p>
<p><img src="image/Personium.png" title="What is Personium?" alt="What is Personium?" /></p>
<h3>Anyone can set up a PDS server</h3>
<p>Because it is a open source software, anyone (business, municipality, government, individual, etc.) can become a PDS provider.</p>
<h3>All functions are REST API</h3>
<p>HTTP can handle any platform (OS, development language), so you do not have to choose the client platform.</p>
<p>GUI examples for both user and administrator are distributed, please feel free to modify and customize it for your needs.</p>
<h3>Specify a remote PDS URL to disclose or grant managing permission to your data</h3>
<p>Each Personium PDS is given a URL.</p>
<p>Disclosing or granting managing permission to your data to the other party (e.g. wife, family doctor, work place, etc.) are done by specifying the other party's PDS URL.</p>
<p>PDS access uses digital signature technology, therefore, the other party's PDS can be resided on another server.</p>

<p>Passive data subjectï¼š For infants, the elderly, etc., PDS can be handed over to the relatives by granting administrative permission of all data to the relatives.</p>
<p><img src="image/PassiveDataSubject.png" title="passive data subject" alt="passive data subject" /></p>
<h3>Configure web of PDS</h3>
<p>Groups of PDSs composed of the data disclosing and disclosed parties become a decentralized network which does not favor a specific business operator (the only winner). (Distributed social graph)</p>
<p>It is possible to form a huge web of PDSs in which the disparate PDSs are linked together as if the web site hosted on a web server built in pieces was linked and www was created.</p>
<p>We also implement security that is necessary for the formation of an open ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Data subject (=PDS owner) can be extended to objects, organizations, etc., not just limited to people</h3>
<p>Data subjects can be extended to objects, organizations, etc. in the same way as dealing with passive data subjects. (e.g. family/dog Poch's data store)</p>
<p>We recommend an integrated model that handles IoM, IoT, and IoE.(Cyber-Physical)</p>
